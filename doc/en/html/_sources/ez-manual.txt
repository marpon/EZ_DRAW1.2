EZ-Draw, to draw in C
=====================

In this document, you will discover how to create small C programs 
that draw in windows, interact with the user at the keyboard or mouse,
make animations or display images.

Everything has been simplified at the maximum and fit in few files.
Pure magic, your programs will run on Linux, Mac OS and Windows.

This documentation is presented in two parts :
  * the tutorial introduces notions step by step, with many examples;
  * the reference manual describes all the available functions.

For easy navigation, you also have an index and a quick search box (on the left).
